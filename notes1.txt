#char	
Smallest addressable unit of the machine that can contain basic character set. It is an integer type. Actual type can be either signed or unsigned. It contains CHAR_BIT bits.[3]	8	%c	CHAR_MIN / CHAR_MAX	n/a
signed char	Of the same size as char, but guaranteed to be signed. Capable of containing at least the [−127, +127] range.[3][a]	8	%c (or %hhi for numerical output)	SCHAR_MIN / SCHAR_MAX[5]	n/a
unsigned char	Of the same size as char, but guaranteed to be unsigned. Contains at least the [0, 255] range.[6]	8	%c (or %hhu for numerical output)	0 / UCHAR_MAX	n/a

signed short
signed short int	Short signed integer type. Capable of containing at least the [−32,767, +32,767] range.[3][a]	16	%hi or %hd	SHRT_MIN / SHRT_MAX	n/a

#unsigned short
unsigned short int	Short unsigned integer type. Contains at least the [0, 65,535] range.[3]	16	%hu	0 / USHRT_MAX	n/a

#int

unsigned long long
unsigned long long int	Long long unsigned integer type. Contains at least the [0, 18,446,744,073,709,551,615] range.[3] Specified since the C99 version of the standard.	64	%llu	0 / ULLONG_MAX	both u or U and ll or LL[7]

#float	Real floating-point type, usually referred to as a single-precision floating-point type. Actual properties unspecified (except minimum limits); however, on most systems, this is the IEEE 754 single-precision binary floating-point format (32 bits). This format is required by the optional Annex F "IEC 60559 floating-point arithmetic".		Converting from text:[b]

#double	Real floating-point type, usually referred to as a double-precision floating-point type. Actual properties unspecified (except minimum limits); however, on most systems, this is the IEEE 754 double-precision binary floating-point format (64 bits). This format is required by the optional Annex F "IEC 60559 floating-point arithmetic".

#long double	Real floating-point type, usually mapped to an extended precision floating-point number format. Actual properties unspecified. It can be either x86 extended-precision floating-point format (80 bits, but typically 96 bits or 128 bits in memory with padding bytes), the non-IEEE "double-double" (128 bits), IEEE 754 quadruple-precision floating-point format (128 bits), or the same as double. See the article on long double for details.		%Lf %LF
